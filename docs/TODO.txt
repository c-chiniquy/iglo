TODO: Fix Linux segmentation fault during window close.
      This is caused by the interaction between X11 and the NVIDIA driver.
      Someone else had a similar problem and fixed it by unloading the X11 window before unloading the vulkan instance:
      https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-LoaderAndValidationLayers/issues/1894
      I tried both unload orders, but the segfault persists.
      When unloading the vulkan instance before the window, it segfaults in XCloseDisplay().
      When unloading the window before the vulkan instance, it segfaults in _XSend() (called by the NVIDIA driver) while cleaning up the vulkan instance.

TODO: Maybe create an iglo test project that runs a set of tests (ig::Texture DDS loading,
      ig::Font behavior, etc.) to catch accidental breakage in future commits.

TODO: Write iglo tutorials and guides.

TODO: Helper functions/classes for common 3D rendering operations, such as parsing mesh files,
      provide common material shaders/pipelines, etc.

TODO: A tool to convert a BMFont .fnt text file to iglo PrebakedFontData struct or iglo prebaked font file.
      iglo currently relies on STB's font rasterizer, but BMFont can rasterize glyphs at higher quality,
      which is especially noticeable at small font sizes.
      Useful for users who want better looking non-SDF fonts.

TODO: Support for BC6 and BC7 block compression formats (when loading DDS textures).

TODO: The BaseCamera class can probably be improved somewhat.

TODO: In D3D12, using CreatePlacedResource() is faster than using CreateCommittedResource().
      Since iglo D3D12 currently uses CreateCommittedResource(), it creates textures/buffers a bit slower than it could.
      To make it faster, we need to write a resource heap memory manager from scratch.

TODO: The D3D12 ig::Texture implementation should hold a CPU-only non-shader-visible descriptor for use with
      rendertexture / depthbuffer / unordered access clear. Maybe call this struct ig::NonShaderDescriptor? For D3D12 only.
      Since these descriptors are CPU-only, i think we can allocate multiple CPU-only descriptor heaps in chunks as needed,
      maybe 1000 descriptors at once. Not having to create new RTV/DSV descriptors every time you set or clear a render target
      would provide a small performance boost and would reduce the size of ig::Texture since it wouldn't have to contain
      a large RTV/DSV desc struct.

TODO: Ability for window to fully capture mouse. This is required for first person shooter games.
